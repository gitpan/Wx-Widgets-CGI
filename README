Wx::Widgets::CGI version 0.01
=============================

When starting to learn wxPerl, it can be frustrating
trying to figure out which widgets handle what functionality.
If you've ever done CGI development, you soon realize why
it's not a bad idea to leverage the web browser as a graphical
user interface: it can be complicated to implement functionality
that you take for granted as an HTML/CGI developer.

This module tries to make implementing wxPerl dialogs friendlier
to a Perl CGI programmer by using an API similar to CGI.pm.
(Specifically, it supports what I consider to be a
useful/relevant subset of CGI.pm's :standard export tags.)
It tries to adhere as faithfully as reasonable to the CGI
API where applicable, and otherwise to try to do something
intuitive.

For more details, read `perldoc Wx::Widgets::CGI`.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Currently test.pl only tests whether the module loads,
then it runs a demo. (You'll have to close the window
yourself.)


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires wxPerl to be installed.
I've only tried it with wxPerl 0.11, wxGTK on Linux.
